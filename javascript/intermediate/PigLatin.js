//Translate the provided string to pig latin.

//Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".

//If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.

//Input strings are guaranteed to be English words in all lowercase

function translatePigLatin(str) {
//
//create a variable that contains all vowels
//iterate through each letter in str
//slice letters before the first vowel and append it to the the same word
//after appending consonants append "ay" to the string.
//but if a word begins with a vowel then just add "way" to the end of the word
//
